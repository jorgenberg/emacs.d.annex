# emacs.d.annex
Extensions to [Steve Purcell's .emacs.d](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d).

To use this, you will need a lightly modified `.emacs.d`, in particular, a suitable [`init-local.el`](https://github.com/tesujimath/emacs.d/blob/master/lisp/init-local.el).  Then, clone this directory into `~/.emacs.d.annex`.

Among others, customisations exist for:
- Go
- Julia
- AUCTex

Contributions are welcome.
